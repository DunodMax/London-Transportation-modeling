# London-Transportation-modeling
This project intend to model mathematical behaviour of London travellers.

The code is presented on a Jupyter Notebook (see dependencies) and should be run like a Jupyter Notebook.
Download the file named "Modeling" and open it with means of Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda ( see dependencies)
